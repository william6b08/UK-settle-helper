# UK-settle-helper Landing Page

I would like to make a good use of my hiatus duration the planning on moving to UK to learn more web development skills. I am committed to make a good use of my time and learn as much as I can with the tools provided for me.

This is the reason why I would like to use UK as a topic of my landing page exercise. Currently, I only know the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Since this would be my first project on creating a landing page, it is a good idea to use UK as my starting topic. Before going to UK, I would like to know more about this place. For example, culture, medical benefits, local scenaries and employment opportunity. Since I am in need of a good topic to build my webpage with. I reckon introducing UK in this webpage would be a great start for my project.

Step 1 (Current): I would like to create a landing page, this will show some pictures and have a few links where visitors can click on and know more about United Kingdom.

Sections of the website: 1. Culture 2. Cuisine 3. Employment Opportunities 4. famously historical site(Or museums)

Step2: Planning to upgrade my webpage with more functionalities as I move forward and learn more about JavaScript.
